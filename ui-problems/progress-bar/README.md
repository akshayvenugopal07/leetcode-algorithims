Create a progress bar that is 200px wide, 20px tall and loads from 0 to 100% of its width in 5 seconds (20% every 1 second). No CSS animations - use JS to advance the progress bar until 100%.
Create a button that adds progress bars to the page on click
Update your code so that only 1 progress bar can be loading at a time, but you can still add progress bars to the page on button click. The next progress bar should begin loading once the previous bar has completed loading.
Update your code so that 5 progress bars can be loading at a time, but you can still add progress bars to the page on button click. A bar should only begin loading if fewer than 5 are currently loading.
Add a button next to each progress bar to remove the progress bar from the page when clicked
