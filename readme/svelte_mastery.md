## WEEK 1 â€“ Core Svelte Concepts

**Topics:**

* [ ] What Svelte is and why it exists â€“ Learn that Svelte is a compiler that converts declarative components into highly efficient imperative JavaScript at build time.
* [ ] Components, props, and slots â€“ Understand how to pass data into components and use slots for content composition.
* [ ] Reactive assignments â€“ Use `$:` to automatically update values when dependencies change.
* [ ] Event handling â€“ Learn how to handle DOM events and component events.

**Hands-on Projects:**

* Build a simple counter app
* Experiment with passing props and using slots

## WEEK 2 â€“ State & Reactivity

**Topics:**

* [ ] Stores â€“ Writable, readable, and derived stores for state management.
* [ ] Reactive statements and dependencies â€“ Track automatic updates with `$:`.
* [ ] Context API in Svelte â€“ Share state between parent and child components.

**Hands-on Projects:**
